1) Introduction

The Student Database Management System is a simple console-based project developed in C language.
It allows users (like teachers, administrators, or students) to store, view, search, and delete student information efficiently using file handling.
Instead of relying on traditional registers or spreadsheets, this system keeps student records in a structured binary file (student_info.txt).

2) Objectives

To provide a basic system for managing student information.
To learn and implement C structures, file handling, and menu-driven programming.
To simulate a real-world student database with add, view, search, and delete operations.

3) Features Implemented

  Add Student Record:
    Collects details like name, roll number, class, address, and percentage.
    Stores them in a binary file (student_info.txt).
    Multiple records can be added one after another.

  View Student Records:
    Reads all student data from the file.
    Displays records in a formatted output (Name, Roll Number, Class, Address, Percentage).

  Search Student Record:
    Searches a student by roll number.
    Displays the matching student details if found.
    Notifies if the record is not available.

  Delete Student Record:
    Removes a student record by roll number.
    Creates a temporary file (temp.txt), copies all records except the one to be deleted.
    Replaces the original file with the updated one.
    Ensures database consistency.

  Exit:
    Closes the program gracefully.

4) Technologies / Concepts Used

C Programming Language

Structures (struct student) for grouping student attributes.

File Handling:
fopen(), fclose()
fread(), fwrite()
remove(), rename()

Binary File Storage for structured record-keeping.

5) Limitations

Data stored in a binary file → not human-readable in editors like Notepad.
No update/modify feature for existing records.
No sorting (records are displayed in the order they were entered).
Limited to command-line interface (CLI) – no graphical UI.

5) Possible Future Enhancements

Add Update Student Record functionality.
Implement sorting (e.g., by roll number, name, or percentage).
Allow export/import to CSV or text format for readability.
Add login authentication for secure access.
Build a GUI version using C++/Qt or C with GTK.
Move to database systems (MySQL, SQLite) for large-scale use.

6) Conclusion

This Student Database Management System is a beginner-friendly project that demonstrates how to manage structured data using C programming and file handling.
It provides essential database operations (CRUD → Create, Read, Update, Delete, except update here).
